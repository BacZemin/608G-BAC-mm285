# 608G_LMNA_BAC_EPIC

This is a summary/scripts for the mouse-array data analysis for 608G BAC mice tissue. The 608GBAC mice was developed from the Collins lab and published (Varga 2006 et al, Cabral et al., 2021) and was essentially a KI model for the human progerin mutation. (Their endogenous mLmna is intact)

Overall, they shows some interesting progeric-phenotype as they die prematurely. 

They do show some progressive arterial abnormalities (Varga et al.,), bone problems (Cabral et al., Cubria et al.,) and muscle problems (Hong et al., 2024) and several others including skin, fat etc. Unfortunately, our lab never collected any of the 

There ~96 samples submitted a few years ago collected by Paula and Christy. 

### scripts 

1. making the SE (SummarizedExperiment) object
2. analyzing GG vs. WT
3. visualizations

### ideas/questions

1. Do these tissue samples display aging DNA methylation signatures. 

but then what are aging DNA methylation signatures. 

2. tissue specific signatures? 
3. check 'hyperprloliferation' based off "PMD-solo-WCGW"? 

4. telomere attrition?
